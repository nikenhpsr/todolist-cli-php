## Todolist-CLI

This Todolist-CLI was build with PHP to test my fundamental knowledge in learning PHP for these past few days.

### Tools that I use
- IDE: Neovim
- OS: Fedora 40
- PHP: 8.2

### How to run the CLI
1. Make sure that you can run the PHP on your device
2. run ```php App.php``` from your terminal
